# KSZ8863 Ethernet Example
(See the README.md file in the upper level 'examples' directory for more information about examples.)

## Overview

TODO:
- switch and port mode

This example demonstrates basic usage of KSZ8863. The work flow of the example could be as follows:

1. Install Ethernet driver
2. Send DHCP requests and wait for a DHCP lease
3. If get IP address successfully, then you will be able to ping the device

If you have a new Ethernet application to go (for example, connect to IoT cloud via Ethernet), try this as a basic template, then add your own code.

## How to use example/KSZ8863
TODO:
- global MAC related registers can be accessed from both MAC driver instances

### Hardware Required

To run this example, ...

#### Pin Assignment


### Configure the project

```
idf.py menuconfig
```

See common configurations for Ethernet examples from [upper level](../README.md#common-configurations).

### Build, Flash, and Run

Build the project and flash it to the board, then run monitor tool to view serial output:

```
idf.py -p PORT build flash monitor
```

(Replace PORT with the name of the serial port to use.)

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/index.html) for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.

## Example Output

```bash
I (394) eth_example: Ethernet Started
I (3934) eth_example: Ethernet Link Up
I (3934) eth_example: Ethernet HW Addr 30:ae:a4:c6:87:5b
I (5864) tcpip_adapter: eth ip: 192.168.2.151, mask: 255.255.255.0, gw: 192.168.2.2
I (5864) eth_example: Ethernet Got IP Address
I (5864) eth_example: ~~~~~~~~~~~
I (5864) eth_example: ETHIP:192.168.2.151
I (5874) eth_example: ETHMASK:255.255.255.0
I (5874) eth_example: ETHGW:192.168.2.2
I (5884) eth_example: ~~~~~~~~~~~
```

Now you can ping your ESP32 in the terminal by entering `ping 192.168.2.151` (it depends on the actual IP address you get).
